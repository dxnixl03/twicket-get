# twicket-get
Automatically monitor for tickets for an event.  Useful for high demand events where there is very little ticket availablility. 
Unfortunately, twickets does very little to stop bots from programatically scooping up tickets from its platform and this tool is intended to help regular people compete with those bots. It's not an answer to the problem, which lies in the hands of Twickets, but until Twickets decides to deal with this, this tool should allow you to at least be a player in the game.
